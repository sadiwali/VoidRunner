INSTRUCTION: To play multiplayer, open up an instance of the game, then choose 
'INITIALIZE SERVER'. You will then have an IP which you must give to all others,
and useyourself to connect to the server. You must open another instance of the
game to play (1 instance to host, 1 instance to play).

PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING FILES IN YOUR GAME FOLDER:

	1) MasterServer 	(folder)
	2) VOIDRUNNER_Data 	(folder)
	3) masterserver.bat	(.bat file)
	4) playerInfo.txt	(.txt file)
	5) README.txt		(.txt file)
	6) VOIDRUNNER.exe	(.exe file)
		Please do not attempt to tamper with any of these files.


CONTROLS:

ASD - movement(left, down, right)
Space - movement(jump)
M - Mute music
Escape - Pause Menu
Mouse scrolling down - Zoom out map

NOTE:
When initializing a server, the game wil open up a CMD window. 
Please do not close this, as this manages the server. Upon closing the
server from the game, you can then close this CMD window.
